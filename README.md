# Free Code Camp Leaderboard

My project for the [Build a Camper Leaderboard challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard) as part of the curriculum for the Data Visualization Certification on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

---

## User Stories
1. I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
2. I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
3. I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
